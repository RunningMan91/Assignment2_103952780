# Timothy Bailey - Assignment 2 (Student ID: 103952780)

This repository contains a number of different elements:

  1. My Django Project
      - Full setup including login, logout and main page. In place of a working chat bot, I have included an embedded video of my chatbot working, as embedding the chatbot itself was not necessary as instructed by eLA.
      - These can be found in the Templates directory here: https://github.com/RunningMan91/Assignment2_103952780/tree/main/My%20Django%20Project/Assignment2_root/Assignment2_project/Templates
